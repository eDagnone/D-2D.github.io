Basics:
----------------------------------------------------------------

The game sometimes likes to run at half speed, especially on my PC in eclipse. 
	You will know this is happening if the pinkies fall slowly when killed.
	To fix this, relaunch the game.

Please loop the sound file (e3m2.mid) while playing the game. Just trust me.
	It can be played using windows media player. 
	
Controls are mouse to move, space to shoot, w to cycle weapons up, and s to cycle weapons down.
This game requires skills. If you have none, you can cheat by editing the code ;)

Strats and tips:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Sprite clipping is only a thing in the y axis. Not the x axis.
Staying near the top few rows is better than moving all around
Press your turning direction and spacebar at the same time. This way, you'll never mess up your turning.
Don't chase ammo at the screen borders if you don't need to
Use an actual mouse rather than a trackpad. Mouse acceleration on trackpads sucks for gaming.
There is auto weapon switch if you run out of ammo for a certian weapon.
You have a 6 frame (0.1) second window to land a punch. It's hard. Don't attempt unless you must.
You shoot/punch on release of spacebar
You unlock the opportunity for enemies to drop ammo for:
	shotgun at 20 kills
	RPG at 40 kills 
	BFG (god-weapon) at 100 kills
If you manage to fire the BFG, you win in my eyes (but the game keeps running)
