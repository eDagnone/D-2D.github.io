__How to run:__

Just run the java file called ZombieGame.java. You can do this with an IDE like Eclipse, or open it through command prompt. 

__Premise:__

_This Game was inspired by ID Software's Doom from 1993_

You find yourself surrounded by charging Pinkies (as Doomguy often does), and must slay them until they slay you. 


__Controls:__

Controls are mouse to move, space to shoot, w to cycle weapons up, and s to cycle weapons down.
To shoot a weapon, you must have ammo for it. You start with 20 pistol ammo, and 0 ammo for the shotgun, RPG, and BFG.
You unlock the opportunity for enemies to drop ammo for:
	shotgun at 20 kills
	RPG at 40 kills 
	BFG (god-weapon) at 100 kills
Each enemy you kill has a random chance of dropping ammo (unless you kill them with the bfg). Run over the ammo on the ground to pick it up.
If you run out of ammo, you must resort to punching. You have a 6 frame (0.1) second window to land a punch. It's hard. Note that you punch on the release, and not press, of spacebar.
If you manage to fire the BFG, consider yourself a winner (but the game keeps running)

__Strats and tips:__

Sprite clipping is only a thing in the y axis. Not the x axis.
Staying near the top few rows is better than moving all around
Press your turning direction and spacebar at the same time. This way, you'll never mess up your turning.
Don't chase ammo at the screen borders if you don't need to
Use an actual mouse rather than a trackpad. Mouse acceleration on trackpads sucks for gaming.
There is auto weapon switch if you run out of ammo for a certian weapon.
You have a 6 frame (0.1) second window to land a punch. It's hard. Don't attempt unless you must.
You shoot/punch on release of spacebar

This game requires skills. If you have none, and you know java, you can cheat by editing the source code.
